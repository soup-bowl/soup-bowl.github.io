It's like the guy who operates the auto tune on talent shows, the hero behind the scenes. If the kernel on your computer crashes everything does basically. With linux systems (all computer geeks have experienced a linux system), one possible but bad outcome from a system is a kernel panic, in which it basically gives you a message saying I HATE YOU.

I have even invested in a graphics tablet so I - in theory - should be able to make them faster. The rest of the week outside of work I will be working on the site, and once done I aim to move back to a daily release cycle, or remain weekly depending on my frequency",
