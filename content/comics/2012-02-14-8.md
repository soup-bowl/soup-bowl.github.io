This isn't out of experience this is dedicated to the jerks I see every day, especially last night buying valentines cards at 5pm. My girlfriend is the most wonderful woman in the world, and I am so lucky to have her, so if she sees this (which will be likely, as she'd think the comic is about her) I LOVE YOU UNDISCLOSED NAME FOR PRIVACY! <3<br><br>Oh and don't worry girls, she'll win next valentines ;)
