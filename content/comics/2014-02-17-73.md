This is pretty lame I know, however this comes with a completely unrelated message.<br><br>The reason I've been so inactive is that I have been setting up the new site bowl-of-soup.co.uk. This is a multi-purpose site, however I am constructing the Stick of Celery webcomic to be found at either bowl-of-soup.co.uk comic or comic.bowl-of-soup.co.uk. This is my move to a personalised website and once the site has been constructed I will move all operations there after a month from the completion date.<br><br>In the meantime, I will aim to release comics every Sunday as my inactivity has caused a backlog of ideas, and even a few shorts. I have even invested in a graphics tablet so I - in theory - should be able to make them faster. The rest of the week outside of work I will be working on the site, and once done I aim to move back to a daily release cycle, or remain weekly depending on my frequency
