title: "In Memoriam: Mushu the Bearded Dragon 2022-2025"

It's with a heavy heart to announce that Mushu, our pet beardie and often the muse of various imagery I've used on social media, has passed away after a battle with illness. 

When we chose to adopt a beardie, we were presented with two identical baby clutchlings. Mushu had apparently been bitten badly by another dragon and had a toe missing, which tugged my heart strings from day 1. We've been fortunate to watch our little buddy grow into a vibrant, and somehow very personifiable beardie for a typically isolated species. He'd been with us through a particularly rough period, becoming known humerously as our "emotional support dragon".

He'd become a muse of photography for me as of late (he may have appeared in photos across my sites and social media), thankfully leaving us with lots of treasured memories to reflect on his short time in our lives.

Rest well buddy, free of pain. You've crossed the rainbow bridge into the land of infinite bugs and greens, and lots of places to perch and rest on. You'll be sorely missed.

**Mushu: 20 October 2022 - 22 August 2025**
