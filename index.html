<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h1>

<p>22/M/UK. Developing PHP application since my teens, I am a full-stack developer gaining experience in many popular languages. Exploring the visually stunning areas of HTML, LESS &amp; CSS, chilling with the cool kids in the JavaScript department, and getting my hands dirty behind the scenes with PHP and C#. </p>

<a id="programming-interests" class="anchor" href="#programming-interests" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programming Interests</h1>

<p>I tend to become invested in a particular goal in a time of need. I also love to work with excellent codebase communities all working to a spectacular end goal.</p>

<p>I have a particularly strong interest in <em>WordPress</em> development. A CMS designed to encompass a vast range of usage scenarios, It has captured my interest since the initial days of WordPress Multisite. Recently I have begun developing plugins for the CMS, including bespoke company-related plugins.</p>

<a id="other-interests" class="anchor" href="#other-interests" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Interests</h1>

<p>I have a keen interest in recently-old consoles and handhelds. Many are often depreciated before they have been pushed to their maximum potential. The Sony wonders the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable are currently my all time favourites, even trying to my hand at hardware modifications to bring my PSP back to life.</p>

</h2>

<p>A <em>super</em> simple JavaScript extension built for Chrome, built out of the need for a simple way to cycle tabs for a Wallboard installation. <a href="https://gist.github.com/soup-bowl/6f75cd2f8c042344fedf02521bf113ac">A simple bash script was created</a> for this purpose, but I decided a more interactive method was needed once in Kiosk mode.</p>

<p>This project is available unlisted on the Chrome store, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeboard/fdnnlgfgjjjfafmdhkfndhnoboajdpom">click here to download</a> and try it out. Please be aware while reviewing that the project is in <em>Alpha</em> and is only available for initial testing.</p>

<a id="mailman" class="anchor" href="#mailman" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="https://github.com/soup-bowl/mailman">Mailman</a>
</h2>

<p>A personal test of mine to see how far the WordPress system can be pushed. I have been trying to integrate a simple IMAP mail client into the WordPress system using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/getherbert/herbert">Herbert framework</a>. </p>
