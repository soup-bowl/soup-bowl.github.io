  "body": "# About Me\r\n22/M/UK. Developing PHP application since my teens, I am a full-stack developer gaining experience in many popular languages. Exploring the visually stunning areas of HTML, LESS & CSS, chilling with the cool kids in the JavaScript department, and getting my hands dirty behind the scenes with PHP and C#. \r\n\r\n# Programming Interests\r\nI tend to become invested in a particular goal in a time of need. I also love to work with excellent codebase communities all working to a spectacular end goal.\r\n\r\nI have a particularly strong interest in _WordPress_ development. A CMS designed to encompass a vast range of usage scenarios, It has captured my interest since the initial days of WordPress Multisite. Recently I have begun developing plugins for the CMS, including bespoke company-related plugins.\r\n\r\n# Other Interests\r\nI have a keen interest in recently-old consoles and handhelds. Many are often depreciated before they have been pushed to their maximum potential. The Sony wonders the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable are currently my all time favourites, even trying to my hand at hardware modifications to bring my PSP back to life.\r\n\r\n# Projects\r\n## [Chromeboard](https://github.com/soup-bowl/chromeboard)\r\nA _super_ simple JavaScript extension built for Chrome, built out of the need for a simple way to cycle tabs for a Wallboard installation. [A simple bash script was created](https://gist.github.com/soup-bowl/6f75cd2f8c042344fedf02521bf113ac) for this purpose, but I decided a more interactive method was needed once in Kiosk mode.\r\n\r\nThis project is available unlisted on the Chrome store, [click here to download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeboard/fdnnlgfgjjjfafmdhkfndhnoboajdpom) and try it out. Please be aware while reviewing that the project is in _Alpha_ and is only available for initial testing.\r\n\r\n## [Nutab](https://github.com/soup-bowl/nutab)\r\nMy preferred setup for browsers has always been to have a row of bookmark bar icons, and thanks to the default way Chrome works I no longer needed it to be always visible, as it was on my new tab page. However, new tab modifiers that give you a more visually pleasing page never implement this, so I worked on building my own new tab replacer for Chrome.\r\n\r\n## [Mailman](https://github.com/soup-bowl/mailman)\r\nA personal test of mine to see how far the WordPress system can be pushed. I have been trying to integrate a simple IMAP mail client into the WordPress system using the wonderful [Herbert framework](https://github.com/getherbert/herbert). \r\n\r\n## [MySQL Backup Manager](https://github.com/soup-bowl/MySQL-Backup-Manager)\r\nA simple GUI tool for Windows that can schedule regular backups of a MySQL database.\r\n_(Company-related or contract applications are not stored on GitHub)_.",
